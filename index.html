			<h2>Month 2</h2>

			<h2>Month 4</h2>
			<p>April 28, 2017 made 4 months. I honestly couldn't be any more blessed than I am now to have a man like Devon. Over the last 4 months, he has opened me up to love. Slowly but surely, I've learned to trust again. </p>

	<h2>{Note to Devon}</h2>
	<p>It's been a long journey, babe. When we met, you made me nervous. I was afraid to open up and get comfortable with you. Now, you are one of my only sources of comfort. I used to enjoy being alone and away from everyone; I'd rather be with you. I choose you over my solitude. When I'm with you, I feel care free effortlessly. I want to be here for you no matter what the situation is. It's me and you, dev. I'm happy I can be by your side while you continue growing into the best man I know. </p>



	<h2>6 Things I love About My Man:</h2>
	<p>1. His personality. His goofy matches mine and nothing's better than having someone to share endless laughs with.</p>
	<p>2. His freckles. I believe they are the cutest things ever.</p>
	<p>3. My boy fly! Enough said, lol.</p>
	<p>4. I love how he handles me. He has the softest touch that makes my heart feel warmer than a hot, July afternoon.</p>
	<p>5.He allows me to be myself. I feel more like myself when I'm with him than any other time.</p>
	<p>6. I love the person he is. His integrity soothes me.</p>
